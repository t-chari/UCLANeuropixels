# UCLANeuropixels

## Overview

This repository is used by trainees at UCLA using Neuropixels. The goal of this repository is to share information/code/demos that would help
with experiments using Neuropixels. Trainnes are encouraged to upload code, videos or documents that could help other Neuropixels users.

See the Wiki for information on the Workshop Series we will be planning this Spring Quarter 2023.
